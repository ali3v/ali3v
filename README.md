Offensive Security | Penetration Testing | Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity professional with experience across Help Desk, IT Management, and technical leadership roles. A strong foundation in building, operating, and securing IT infrastructure has shaped my interest in understanding both how systems are attacked and how they can be effectively defended.

Currently specializing in cybersecurity at Holberton School, while developing hands-on skills through practical labs and real-world scenarios on platforms such as Hack The Box and TryHackMe. Alongside offensive security training, I am intentionally expanding my knowledge of defensive security concepts, incident response, and risk management to maintain a well-rounded security perspective.

My long-term goal is to grow into a security professional who can contribute across offensive, SOC, and GRC functions by identifying vulnerabilities, assessing risk, and supporting organizations in strengthening their overall security posture.

## 💭 Philosophy

*"The best way to defend systems is to understand how they're attacked. The best way to understand attacks is to execute them yourself (in authorized environments, obviously)."*

Formal education provides structure. CTF platforms provide practice. Real-world experience? That's what I'm chasing next.
