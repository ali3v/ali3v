**`Offensive Security | Penetration Tester | Red Team Enthusiast`**

Former IT manager who got bored managing infrastructure and decided breaking it was way more interesting. Currently deep in cybersecurity training at Holberton School while hunting vulns on HackTheBox and TryHackMe. 

Transitioned from helpdesk → sysadmin → IT lead → offensive security. That background in building and defending systems? Turns out it's incredibly useful when you're trying to compromise them.

## 💭 Philosophy

*"The best way to defend systems is to understand how they're attacked. The best way to understand attacks is to execute them yourself (in authorized environments, obviously)."*

Formal education provides structure. CTF platforms provide practice. Real-world experience? That's what I'm chasing next.
