## Hey, I'm Elnur 👋

Cybersecurity student @ Holberton School, currently pivoting from IT management into offensive security. 

Started in helpdesk years back, worked my way up to IT lead role, but realized I'm way more interested in breaking things than managing them. So here I am - learning red team tactics, exploit development, and generally trying to think like an attacker.

---

### Current focus

Red team operations and offensive security:
- Web app pentesting (SQLi, XSS, authentication bypasses, session attacks)
- Network exploitation and pivoting techniques  
- Active Directory enumeration and attacks
- Custom exploit scripting in Python

Mainly working through Holberton's cybersecurity track while practicing on HTB and THM boxes in my spare time.

---

### Certifications

**eJPT** - eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester  
**CEH Master** - Certified Ethical Hacker (Master level)

Currently prepping for OSCP, planning to take the exam sometime this year.

---

### Tools I use regularly

**Offensive:** Burp Suite Professional, Metasploit, SQLmap, Bloodhound, Impacket, Responder  
**Recon:** Nmap, Masscan, enum4linux, Wireshark, tcpdump  
**Exploitation:** Custom Python scripts, PHP shells, various C2 frameworks  
**Environments:** Kali Linux (daily driver), HackTheBox VMs, TryHackMe labs

---

### Practice platforms

Been active on HackTheBox and TryHackMe for a while now. Rooted a decent number of boxes, learned most of my practical skills there honestly. CTFs are great for theory but nothing beats actually popping shells on realistic targets.

Some of my writeups and solutions are scattered across my repos, mostly the stuff I found interesting or challenging enough to document.

---

### Main repo

Most of my Holberton coursework and projects live here:  
→ [holbertonschool-cyber_security](https://github.com/ali3v/holbertonschool-cyber_security)

Covers everything from basic linux hardening to web exploitation and network security. Check the commit history for the actual work.

---

### Background

Spent a few years in traditional IT - helpdesk, sysadmin work, eventually managing IT operations. Decent experience with infrastructure, networking, AD environments. That knowledge actually helps a lot now when attacking those same systems.

Decided to make the switch to security because honestly, the offensive side is just way more interesting. Plus the industry needs people who understand both sides - how to build systems AND how they break.

---

### What I'm looking for

Junior red team / pentester positions, security analyst roles, anything where I can use these skills practically. Open to internships too if it means getting real-world experience.

Also down to collaborate on projects, CTF teams, or just trade notes on interesting techniques.

---

### Contact

Hit me up if you want to discuss security stuff, need help with CTF challenges, or just want to connect.  
Check my repos for examples of what I can actually do.
